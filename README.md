Repo for MongoDB User Group Meetups

Folders for each Meetup are named year.month.day eg. 15.9.3 for Sep 15th 2015 (our first meetup).  Inside each
folder will be and agenda.txt file with the agenda for that meeting.  Additionally, we'll try to add other
supporting files related to the presentation(s) for that meeting.
